# Basics_of_Java
1 what is java
        java is a high level programming language. it is object oriented & basd on the object model. it has a advantage over other languages that it is platform independent.
2 c++ vs java
        c++ -->                                             
        platfoen depended
        used for system programing
        supports multiple inheritance
        supports operator overloading
        uses on compiler {compiler converts sourcecode into machine code} so machine depended
        supports structure & unions 
        no comments supported
        --------------------------------
        Java -->
        platform indepented
        for application programming
        multiple inheritance can be achived using interfaces
        no operator overloading
        both compiler & interpreter {sourcecode to bytecode at compilation time. the interpreter execute this bytecode at runtime & give o/p} so platforn independent.
        not suppoeted ( structure & unions )
        comments allowed
 3 What is JDk , JRE, JVM?
        $ JDK - java development kit = is  a software development used fo developming java applications it includes the JRE (java runtime eniournment ) interpreter , compiler 
        an archiver (jar) a documentation generator (jvadoc)
        $ JVM java virtual machine
